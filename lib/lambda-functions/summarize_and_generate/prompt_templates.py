    Here is the list of input texts:

    </input_texts>

    Output guidance:
        - Never set up any preambles.
        - The final answer should be in the style of professional technical report.
        - The final answer should be in Markdown format, and emphasize the key phrases or identities using bold font.
        - Please conclude your response by succinctly recapping the main points at the beginning of your final output, without using the phrase 'In summary'.
        - Start your response with an overview paragraph highlighting the key points, avoiding the phrase 'In summary'. Follow this with detailed explanations, ensuring the final summary is at the beginning and conclusions are woven into the narrative without using bullet points to start.
        - Please enclose the final answer in XML tags, with root tag as <Output></Output>. Use <Summary></Summary> to indicate the final answer.

    REMEMBER: Never use phrases like 'input texts' or 'To answer the question' or 'in summary' in the final answer!
